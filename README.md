Q. There are bugs/issues!   
A. Please use [Github's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/GaiusSensei/ws-gate/issues) to report any bugs & issues that you encounter.  

Q. When are you going to add more card sets?  
A. If it's an English cardset, then it's on my roadmap. If it's a Japanese cardset, then I'm sorry but I have no plans of adding them. If you know  Javascript however, feel free to take a look at the Cardset JS files, make one of your own, and make a pull request.
